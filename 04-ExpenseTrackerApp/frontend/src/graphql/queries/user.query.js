- This code defines GraphQL queries using the Apollo Client library.
- The first query, GET_AUTHENTICATED_USER, retrieves data about the currently authenticated user.
- The second query, GET_USER_AND_TRANSACTIONS, retrieves data about a specific user and their transactions.
- These queries are useful for fetching user-related data from a GraphQL API.
