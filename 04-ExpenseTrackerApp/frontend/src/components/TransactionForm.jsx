- This code defines a React functional component for a transaction form.
- It uses Apollo Client's useMutation hook to handle GraphQL mutations.
- The form collects transaction details such as description, payment type, category, amount, location, and date.
- Upon submission, it sends the transaction data to the server and displays success or error messages using react-hot-toast.
