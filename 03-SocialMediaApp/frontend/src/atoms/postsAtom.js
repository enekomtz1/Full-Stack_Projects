/*
- This code defines a state management atom using the Recoil library.
- The atom is intended to manage the state of posts within an application.
- It is named 'postsAtom' and serves as a unique identifier for the atom.
- Initially, the default state of this atom is set to an empty array.
- The atom can be imported and used in different parts of the application to maintain consistent state.
*/

	default: [], // Default value for the atom's state, initially an empty array
});
